# Clinic-Management-System-PostgreSQL-and-Csharp
This .NET WindowsForm App is created to manage a clinic to add a new patient or add a new examination and also to list them. PostgreSQL is used as the database.
Program is also created to improve basic SQL query skills and designing databases as a student of Computer Engineering.

Please Note that since this is a database based program, you may not make it work with all functions dependent on database such as CRUD operations. So please take a look at the Project Document down below. Thank you so much for reviewing and comments in advance!
